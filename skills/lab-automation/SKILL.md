# Lab Automation

## Overview

Convert manual protocols into automation-friendly steps with clear volumes, timing, and deck setup.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify the protocol**: Inputs, outputs, volumes, and critical timings.
2. **Map to hardware**: Identify instruments, modules, and deck slots.
3. **Define labware**: Plates, reservoirs, tip racks, and consumables.
4. **Translate steps**: Aspirate/dispense, mix, incubate, and transfers.
5. **Validate constraints**: Tip usage, minimum volumes, dead volumes.
6. **Document SOP**: Include run order, calibration, and error handling.

## Checklist

* Confirm sample tracking identifiers.
* Define mixing parameters (speed, repetitions).
* Include pause points for manual interventions.
* Track waste disposal and reagent replenishment.

## Outputs

* Stepwise automation script outline (pseudo-steps or vendor-specific)
* Deck layout diagram description
* Run checklist and QC checkpoints
